# Java 11 Certification

Hi there! So this is a complete resource guide for my attempt to get Java 11 Certified. 
On the 18th, January 2021, I passed my "Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 11 Developer" certification.

# Old Rules

So I started my journey to get certified in Java 11 to receive Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Developer credentials. Before 1st, October 2020, it was fairly a two-step process:
 - [Take a 815 exam](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-programmer-i/pexam_1Z0-815) Post 1st, October 2020, it is displaying a 404.
 - [And a 816 exam](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-programmer-i/pexam_1Z0-816) Post 1st, October 2020, it is displaying a 404.

Both costs approximately 11,300 INR each and covers a different set of the syllabus.

You have to purchase the exam voucher from Oracle for each one of these. The voucher will be valid for the next 6 months. And during this period, you can schedule the exam anytime.

I did that too, but as soon as I was prepared for 815, THE Oracle changed the game. They were retiring both 815 and 816 in favor of 819.

## Oracle did it again!!

And as if 2020 was less weird, Oracle discontinued Java certification test 815 and 816. And in place of it, Java Test 819 was introduced.
[The new 819 exam](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-developer/pexam_1Z0-819)

## Few features of this new exam
- It is a 90 min exam as compared to 180 min ( for 815 and 816 each ).
- The total number of questions is reduced to 50, and you need to mark 34 questions correctly to pass.
- It costs approximately **18,538 INR** plus taxes.
- Covers almost all the topics from exam 815 and 816, with few exceptions. Check out the [819](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-developer/pexam_1Z0-819) links for a detailed syllabus.
- You will receive "Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 11 Developer" as Oracle recognition.


# Important Topics
Below are the list of some of important topics and resources that is used to prepare them.

## Stream, Lambdas and Funtional Interfaces 
- [Streams, Lambdas, Functional Interfaces](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/functional-programming-with-streams-in-java-9)
- [Stream API Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html)
- [Stream Operations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#StreamOps)
- [Stream Tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-streams)
- [Processing Data with Java SE 8 Streams](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams.html)
- [Method detail of Object class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html)
  This is important because many times we are asked to identify a Function Interface and an inteface with no abstract method and a Object class method is not a function interface.
